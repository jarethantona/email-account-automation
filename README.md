## Application Information

Inspired by some of the archaic tasks in data entry I have done during my time as an HR Assistant, I have created a command line application written in Java that is designed to simplify email account creation for employees. In this handy application, the user will enter their full name and shift preference and Java will in turn create an employee account that includes an email and a randomly-generated password.
